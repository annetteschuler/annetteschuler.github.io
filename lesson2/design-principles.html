        <h4>Delta Airlines</h4>

        <p>The Delta Airlines website displays Visual Heirarchy nicely. One of the top items displayed 
            is the From-To search. By using larger font and placing it near the top it successfully draws 
            your attention to booking or checking on a flight. The average consumer can easily purchase tickets
            making them more successful.  The lower level items include vacations, hotels, car rentals and gift cards.

    <h4>Taco Bell</h4>

    <p>The Taco Bell website displays a couple design elements nicely, but I picked the rule of thirds.
        The picture on the top of their website goes approximately a third down the page which is pleasing to
        the eye and nicely follows the rule of thirds.  If you actually continue going down the page (not shown on this
        screenshot) they repeat the menu items in boxes which are very similar in size and structure.  Then if you scroll
        down further, the purple and pink grid makes their menu very attractive looking with their popular
        menu items showing icons and names in boxes all demonstrating repetition.  This format makes it very user-friendly.

        <section class="white"> <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3> 
            <h4>Chick-Fil-A</h4>
            <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com">https://www.chick-fil-a.com</a> <br>
            <img src="images/rsz_wwwchick-fil-acom_.png" alt="chick-fil-a mobile view screenshot">
            <p>The Chick-Fil-A website uses a large amount of white space and clean design. With mainly red used to 
                display sparce images and font, it is really easy to read and navigate. They have a blue line about
                ordering ahead. Their logo is very recognizable. If you click on a menu item, a photograph of the 
                food displays. It is nice, simple and clean.
