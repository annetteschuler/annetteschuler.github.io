            <h3>History of Rochester</h3>
            <p>The area developed as a stagecoach stop between Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Dubuque, Iowa near 
                the Zumbro River. The community was founded by George Head and his wife Henrietta who built log 
                cabin named Head's Tavern in 1854 and named the city after his hometown of Rochester, New York.[9] 
                When the Winona and St Peter Railroad initiated service in October 1864, it brought new residents 
                and business opportunities and spurred growth. In 1863, Dr. William W. Mayo arrived as the examining 
                surgeon for Union draftees in the Civil War. Rochester celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2004. (Wikipedia)
